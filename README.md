# PySimpleAuth
PySimpleAuth is a simple GUI-based login and signup form built using the PySimpleGUI library and SQLite3. It is designed for beginner-level developers who want to learn how to create graphical user interfaces with Python and manage user data with a SQLite3 database. This project provides a practical example of how to combine these technologies to build a functional application with essential features such as user authentication and data persistence.
